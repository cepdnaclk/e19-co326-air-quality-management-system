We are trying our best to anticipate the needs and requirements of users based on the feedback we get from users. From this
information we create and maintain [Project Boards](https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono/projects?type=classic) on GitHub
for upcoming Hono versions.

We also maintain a more formal [track record of all released versions](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.hono/governance).

We try to maintain a steady pace of releases every three months with milestones in between. However, due to changes in
requirements over time and because we all have only limited time to spend on Hono, the scope of the releases may change
over time as well. The best way to make sure that a certain feature that you anticipate or need the most actually makes
it into a release, is by [becoming a contributor]({{< relref "contributing.md" >}}) and/or committer to Hono yourself.
